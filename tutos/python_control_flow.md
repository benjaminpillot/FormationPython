## Statements

### if-then-(else) statement
Whenever you want to express a conditional statement, you can use an `if-then-(else)`:
```python
n = 9
if n >= 9:
    do_stuff()
else:
    do_other_stuff()
```

You may also use several different conditions:

```python
if 2<n<9:
    do_stuff()
elif 9<=n<50:
    do_other_stuff()
else:
    do_something()
```

### try-except-(else)-(finally) statement
The Python community uses an EAFP (easier to ask for forgiveness than permission) coding style. Typically, the following code is not _pythonic_:
```python
import os

if os.path.exists("file.txt"):
    os.unlink("file.txt")
```

Now, the best practice is to regard the file as existing, and catch any problems as exceptions. In that case, if the file does not exist, the problem will be caught as an `OSError` exception:
```python
import os

try:
    os.unlink("file.txt")
except OSError:
    pass
```

### Context managers (`with` statements)
In Python, you may use a context manager where conditions applied only within the statement. For example, you may do the following with a file:
```python
file = open("file.txt")
# Do some stuff with the file
file.close()
```
However, that means you must not forget to close the file each time you open it. Very not that efficient and clear. Conversely, you can use a context manager, such as:
```python
with open("file.txt") as file:
    # Do some stuff with the file
```
The context manager will automatically close the file as soon as the program exits the statement.


## Loops

### `while` loop
* The typical `while` loop in Python:
```python
n = 0
while n < 1000:
    do_stuff()
    n += 1 
```
* The `while`-`do` from C adapted to Python:
```python
while "This string is always true":
    output = do_stuff()
    
    if output == "exit":
        break
```

### `for` loop
The `for` loop iterates over values in iterators (list, tuple, dict, collection) or generators:
```python
>>>for value in [2, 3, 9, "a string"]:
...    print(value)
...
2
3
9
a string
```

```python
>>>adict = {'a key': [9,8], 'another key': "a string"}
>>>for key in adict.keys():
...    print(adict[key])
...
[9,8]
a string
```

```python
# Use a generator as the function range()
for item in range(0, 10):
    do_stuff(item)
```




## Iterators and generators

### Iterators vs. generator
A collection is an _iterable_ object over which we may iterate. They can return an _iterator_, that will be used to get values incrementally. That's what the `for` loop basically does. The iterator uses in-memory objects, while _generators_ __yield__ values. That is, a generator does the same job, but only returns a value when necessary:
```python
>>> for n in [0, 1, 2, 3]:
...     print(n)

0
1
2
3
>>> for n in range(0, 4):
...     print(n)
0
1
2
3
```
Both iterator (iterable list) and generator (`range()` function) return the exact same output. But now, try to print both objects:
```python
>>> my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3]
>>> print(my_list[1:3])
[1, 2]
>>> my_gen = range(0, 4)
>>> print(my_gen[1:3])
range(1, 3)
```
There is no value set in memory for the generator. If you try to get a slice of it, it will only return a sub-generator object.

### Building a generator
Any iterable will serve as an iterator. But, how do we manage to create a generator in Python? We use the following syntax with the keyword `yield`:
```python
def range(start, stop):
    n = 0
    while n < stop:
        n += 1
        yield n
```


## Comprehension lists
An efficient way for creating collections is the well-known _comprehension list_ form. Rather than doing:
```python
alist = [2,3,4,9,8,7]
my_list = []
for m in alist:
    mylist.append(m/2)
```

Do that:
```python
my_list = [m/2 for m in [2,3,4,9,8,7]]
```

This is faster, clearer and more _pythonic_.
